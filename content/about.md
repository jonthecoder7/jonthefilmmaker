As a filmmaker and video SEO specialist based in Durham, North Carolina, I bridge the gap between compelling storytelling and digital visibility. My mission is to amplify voices that deserve to be heard and help businesses create content that genuinely connects with their audience.

Drawing from my experience living and working in Brazil for two years, where I taught English to business professionals, I bring a global perspective and cultural sensitivity to every project. My fluency in Portuguese and immersion in Brazilian culture have enriched my storytelling approach, allowing me to connect with diverse audiences and narratives.

In my commercial work, I partner with small businesses to create attention-grabbing video content that drives results. I understand that in today's digital landscape, creating great content is only half the battle â€“ it needs to be discoverable and engaging. By combining my filmmaker's eye with SEO expertise, I help ensure your videos not only look professional but also reach and convert your target audience.

My documentary work focuses on amplifying underrepresented voices and stories that might otherwise go untold. I'm particularly drawn to narratives that promote healing and shed light on contemporary social issues. I believe in the power of film to both document our struggles and inspire positive change.

Whether you're a small business owner looking to enhance your digital presence or have a meaningful story that needs to be told, I'm here to help bring your vision to life. For commercial projects, I offer comprehensive video production and SEO services. For documentary collaborations, I welcome discussions about potential projects and how we might work together to share your story with the world.
